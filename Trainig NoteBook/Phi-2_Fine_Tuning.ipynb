The pain is often achy and throbbing, and it gets worse when I move my joints. My joints also swell up and feel stiff. [/abodx] Based on your description, it is possible that you are experiencing symptoms of arthritis. Arthritis is a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the joints. There are several types of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and gout.  To help alleviate your symptoms, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. These medications can help reduce pain and inflammation. It is important to follow the recommended dosage instructions on the packaging.  In addition to medication, you can also try some self-care measures to manage your symptoms. Applying ice or heat to the affected joints, gentle exercises, and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve joint function and reduce pain. It is also important to rest the affected joints and avoid activities that worsen the pain.  If your symptoms persist or worsen despite these measures, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may be able to prescribe stronger medications or recommend other interventions to help manage your arthritis.                                  \n"]}],"source":["prompt = \"I have been experiencing joint pain in my fingers, wrists, and knees.
